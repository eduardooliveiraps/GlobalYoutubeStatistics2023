# Supermarket Sales EDA

Welcome to the Supermarket Sales EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project! This repository contains an in-depth analysis of a supermarket sales dataset, exploring various aspects of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide valuable insights and answers to analytical questions through exploratory data analysis. The main objectives are:

- Explore the dataset's structure, dimensions, and data types.
- Perform data cleaning and preparation for analysis.
- Answer key analytical questions related to sales, customers, and product categories.
- Visualize trends, relationships, and patterns using different types of plots.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

- **data:** Contains the dataset used for analysis (`supermarket_sales.csv`).
- **notebooks:** Contains the Jupyter Notebook file that capture the analysis process (`Supermarket_Sales_EDA.ipynb`)

## Notebook Structure

The Jupyter Notebook is divided into three main parts:

1. **Data Exploration:** In this section, the dataset's basic information, such as size, data types, and initial records, is examined. It provides a preliminary understanding of the data.
2. **Data Preparation:** Here, data cleaning and transformation steps are undertaken to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
3. **Data Analysis:** The core of the notebook is dedicated to answering analytical questions related to the dataset. Each question is explored, analyzed, and visualized using appropriate charts and plots.
   
## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks` folder and open the Jupyter Notebook (`Supermarket_Sales_EDA.ipynb`).
3. Run the notebook cells in sequence to follow the analysis process.
4. Customize and expand the analysis as needed for your own insights.

## Dependencies

The analysis is conducted using the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
